# VHDL-Moore-FSM
A moore finite state machine coded in VHDL that will recognizes two strings "1001" and "0101", count how many times they appear in a string
of input, and output that number.

This project is created using Vivado 2018.1. 
The source file with the code for the finite state machine is contained in fsm.srcs -> sources_1/new.
The testbench file for simulation of the code is contained in fsm.srcs -> sim_1/new.

Steps to open up the project:
1. Download the Vivado Design Suite
2. Clone this repository
3. Open up the file fsm.xpr in Vivado
